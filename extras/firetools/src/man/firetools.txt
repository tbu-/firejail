.SH ABOUT FIREJAIL
Firejail is a SUID sandbox program that reduces the risk of security breaches by
restricting the running environment of untrusted applications using Linux
namespaces, seccomp-bpf and Linux capabilities.
It allows a process and all its descendants to have their own private view of the
globally shared kernel resources, such as the network stack, process table, mount table.
Firejail can work in a SELinux or AppArmor environment,
and it is integrated with Linux Control Groups.
